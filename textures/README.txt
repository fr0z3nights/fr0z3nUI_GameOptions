Put your .tga textures here.

In Lua, reference them like:
	Interface\\AddOns\\fr0z3nUI_GameOptions\\textures\\YourTexture.tga

Quick start (in-game):
	/fgo
	Go to the Textures tab
	Click New, then pick a texture and adjust size/pos

Texture list generator:
	Double-click texturesUpdater.cmd to regenerate textures.lua

Tip: Keep texture filenames simple; the picker uses *.tga names.
